
Project 6 - Choose Your Own Project

    Due Jan 12, 2023 by 11:59pm Points 100 Submitting a file upload

For your last project, you can decide what you want to program. Here are the rules:

    Must be significant in length. If you need a guideline, then think 75 to 150 lines of code (excluding empty lines and comments), but could be less if you're good at writing compact code.
    Must use at least one of each:
        Array
        Object
        Function
        Promise or async/await
        Template string
    You can add HTML if you want, but I'm only grading your .js file(s)
    npm modules not required, but allowed

I'll be grading on creativity, along with the requirements above and clean code (hint: right click and select "Format Document").
Ideas

    A calculator program that accepts user input from the terminal
    A simple RPG battle game
    A program that gives directions on how to solve a Rubiks cube
    A program that accepts user input and prints ASCII art (see: https://texteditor.com/ascii-art/ 

    Links to an external site.)
    Yahtzee or some other dice game
