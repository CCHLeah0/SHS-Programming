C++, controlled by rules counsel
high level, compiled, strongly typed
(easier to understand for people)
compiled vs interpreted:
- interpreted
  - executed line by line using precompiled bytecode
  - generally larger programs 
  - generally slower?
- compiled
  - C++ (.cpp and .h files) -> handed to Compiler (MicroSoftVisualCode), which makes a .exe file, which contains low-level machine instructions -> execute.exe
you must declare data types 
semi colon seperates statements (you could in theory write it all in one line if you are Satan)
have to state datatype of parameter for functions
functions have to be declared with double so it has double precision (double makes it run at 32*2 bits)
data type of variables can be changed constantly (JS makes you say if x can be changed or not, in C++ can change is the default option)
variable data type must be declared before the variable
you cant operate on different data types (int*float doesn't work)
